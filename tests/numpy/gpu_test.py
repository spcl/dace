"""
Test CUDA code generation for a subset of numpy-like functions on GPU target.

Only a subset of the numpy tests is executed on GPU target to keep the test
execution time within a reasonable limit. This is of particular interest for
CI regression tests. These testcases are mainly supposed to cover GPU-related
issues reported to the DaCe porject or special cases for GPU code generation.

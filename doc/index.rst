DaCe: Data-Centric Parallel Programming
=======================================

*Decoupling domain science from performance optimization.*

DaCe is a parallel programming framework that takes code in Python/NumPy and 
other programming languages, and maps it to high-performance **CPU, GPU, and FPGA** 
programs, which can be optimized to achieve state-of-the-art. Internally, DaCe 
uses the :ref:`sdfg` *data-centric intermediate 
representation*: A transformable, interactive representation of code based on 
data movement.
Since the input code and the SDFG are separate, it is possible to optimize a 
program without changing its source, so that it stays readable. On the other 
hand, transformations are customizable and user-extensible, so they can be written 
once and reused in many applications.
With data-centric parallel programming, we enable **direct knowledge transfer** 
of performance optimization, regardless of the application or the target processor.

DaCe generates high-performance programs for:

 * Multi-core CPUs (tested on Intel, IBM POWER9, and ARM with SVE)
 * NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs (with HIP)
 * Xilinx and Intel FPGAs

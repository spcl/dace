# Design Documents for DaCe 2.0

The files in this folder represent significant upcoming changes to the design of the DaCe framework.

Briefly, the changes relate to a modular construction of the various DaCe SDFG frontends and backends (i.e., code generation), as well as the hierarchical, more user-friendly view of the SDFG with Control Flow Regions and shared data descriptor repository.

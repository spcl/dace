DIODE2 errata

This file contains a list of potential issues, weird quirks and unintuitive details about DIODE2 and used libraries.


GoldenLayout:EventResponses
Because individual elements can be closed, new data can go two ways:
1) Update the existing component
and, if the component could not be reached
2) Create a new component
This allows more fluent behavior, i.e. there are no windows flashing / layout changing transitions.
The function replaceOrCreate() facilitates this mechanic.
For a sending element to know whether or not case 1) has happened, the receiving component must answer with arbitrary data.
Directly responding works without an issue when event and sender are the same window. If this is not the case, the responding event is dropped,
because GL modifies the sending eventHub such that there are no cycles (i.e. you cannot receive while sending something).
Therefore, instead of using `eh.emit(...)`, one must execute the sending outside of the receive handler, best using a Timeout:
`setTimeout(() => eh.emit(...), 1)`



GoldenLayout:AddingElements
Adding elements inside a popup is not possible (as it has limited sense). However, one can still call
`goldenlayout.root.contentItems[0].addChild()`. This, however, corrupts the element, making
merging it back into the main window impossible. (There is no error when this happens).
Therefore, all operations that are valid only the main window should use events/requests and not access the layout directly.


GoldenLayout:createContentItem
Even though exposed as public method, this function is unusable and fails to setup event handlers and establish invariants.
Do not use; use addChild() instead.


GoldenLayout:StateSavingNull
The standard state saving functions replace null with the empty object {}. If this is inacceptable, the component should save its
state in a JSON-string and load as such.

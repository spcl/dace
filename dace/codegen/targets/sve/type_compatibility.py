"""
    Type compatibility: This module offers a function `assert_type_compatibility` that ensures SVE instructions can work with the given datatypes.
    It throws an IncompatibleTypeError which provides some information.

    It is called almost everywhere in the SVEUnparser, because it checks whether:
        - The types can be represented in SVE
        - An instruction on them can be used (e.g. svint32_t and svfloat32_t in the same context are fundamentally incompatible)
        - Any `None` occurs, which is a hint for failed inference
        - Pointers are mixed with vectors or scalars

# Python Language Reference Supported Features

This document describes in detail which features of Python are supported by the DaCe Python-Frontend.
The comparison is made against the [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/).

## 2 Lexical Analysis

### 2.1 Line Structure
The DaCe Python-Frontend uses the Python AST module to parse code.
Therefore, full support of the line structure section is expected.
However, we explicitly test for the following subsections (`tests/python_frontend/line_structure_test.py`):
- 2.1.3 Comments
- 2.1.5 Explicit Line Joining
- 2.1.6 Implicit Line Joining
- 2.1.7 Blank Lines

### 2.3 Identifiers and Keywords
The DaCe Python-Frontend uses exactly the same rules for identifiers as normal Python.
However, for a generated SDFG to compile to a target architecture, the identifiers used
must be valid in the output language (e.g., C/C++). We currently provide no automatic
transformation of identifiers used as variable names. Therefore, it is the responsibility
of the user to ensure that the variable names are compatible.

#### 2.3.1 Keywords
The following keywords are recognized (for at least a subset of their Python functionality):
- True, False, None
- or, and, not
- if, elif, else
- for, while, break, continue, in
- def, return, lambda, with

The following keywords are NOT accepted:
- global, nonlocal
- class
- try, except, finally
- raise, yield, pass
- import, from, as
- assert, async, await, del

#### 2.3.2 Reserved classes of identifiers
Reserved class of Python identifiers are not supported. Furthermore, identifiers
starting with double underscore (`__`) are reserved by the SDFG language.

### 2.4 Literals
The DaCe Python-Frontend supports in general the same literals as Python.
However, there is currently limited support for strings and char/byte arrays.
For example, it is not possible to instantiate an (u)int8 array with a string
or byte literal.

### 2.5 Operators
The DaCe Python-Frontend supports all Python operators.
The operators are only supported in the context of arithmetic/logical operations among
scalar values and DaCe (NumPy-compatible) arrays. For example, it is not possible
to concatenate 2 strings with the `+` operator.
The `:=` operator (Named Expression) is parsed as an assignment statement.

### 2.6 Delimiters
The DaCe Python-Frontend supports all Python delimiters. However, not all uses of
those delimiters are supported. For example, we do not support lists, sets, and
dictionaries. Therefore, the delimiters `[, ], {, }` cannot be used to define
those datatypes.

## 6 Expressions

### 6.1 Arithmetic Conversions
**NOTE: This is an experimental feature**  
The arithmetic conversions for most binary operators are implemented with casting:
- If any of the operands is of complex type, but the other operand is a float,
  int or bool, then it is cast to the same complex type.
- If any of the operands is of float type, but the other operand is int or bool,
  the it is cast to the same float type.
Some binary operations are handled differently, as described in the sections below.

### 6.2 Atoms
All Python atoms are parsed. However, their intended usage may not be supported:
- Identifiers: Supported
- Literals: Only use of numerical literals supported
- Parethesized forms: Some uses of tuples supported
- Displays for lists, sets and dictionaries: Unsupported
- List displays: Supported only for (supported) method arguments that expect a list/tuple
- Set displays: Unsupported
- Dictionary displays: Unsupported
- Generator expressions: Only the built-in range supported
- Yield expressions: Unsupported

### 6.3 Primaries
Similarly to atoms, Python primaries are parsed. However, their intended usage
may not be supported:
- Attribute references: Supported for a subset of the DaCe and Numpy modules
- Subscriptions: Supported on DaCe/Numpy arrays
- Slicings: Supported on DaCe/Numpy arrays
- Calls: Supported for other DaCe programs, and a subset of methods from the
DaCe and Numpy modules

### 6.4 Await expression
Unsupported  

### 6.5 The power (**) operator
Supported. If the base is an integer and the exponent a signed integer, both
operands are cast to float64 and the result is also of type float64.

### 6.6 Unary arithmetic and bitwise operations
Supported

### 6.7 Binary arithmetic operations
Supported. Notable differences compared to the expected Python result:
- Division between integers returns an integer (like in C/C++)
- Modulo operator always returns a natural number (like in C/C++)

### 6.8 Shifting operations
Only integral types supported.

### 6.9 Binary bitwise operations
Only integral types supported.

### 6.10 Comparisons
Supported

### 6.11 Boolean operations
Supported

### 6.12 Assignment expressions
Experimental support

### 6.13 Conditional expressions
Supported

### 6.14 Lambdas
Supported only for defining WCR/reduction operators

### 6.15 Expression lists
Supported only for (supported) method arguments that expect a list/tuple

### 6.16 Evaluation order
Supported

### 6.17 Operator precedence
Evaluated exactly as in Python.

## 7 Simple Statements

### 7.1 Expression statements
Partially supported, as described in the previous section. Python interactive
mode is not supported.

### 7.2 Assignment statements
Assignment statements with single or multiple targets are supported, both with
and without parentheses. Statements with starred targets are not supported.
Targets may only be identifiers, and subscriptions/slices of Numpy arrays.

#### 7.2.1 Augmented assignment statements
Supported with the same constraints for targets as in assignment statements.

#### 7.2.2 Annotated assignment statements
Unsupported

### 7.3 The assert statement
Unsupported

### 7.4 The pass statement
Supported

### 7.5 The del statement
Unsupported

### 7.6 The return statement
Supported

### 7.7 The yield statement
Unsupported

### 7.8 The raise statement
Unsupported

### 7.9 The break statement
Supported for for/while loops, as long as the break statement is in the same
SDFG-level as the for/while statement.

### 7.10 The continue statement
Supported for for/while loops, as long as the continue statement is in the same
SDFG-level as the for/while statement.

### 7.11 The import statement
Unsupported, including 7.11.1 Future statements

### 7.12 The global statement
Unsupported

### 7.13 The nonlocal statement
Unsupported

## 8 Compound Statements
### 8.1 The if statement
Supported. Note that if the type of some variable depends on the branch taken,
then the variable will always have the type of the first branch. E.g., in the
following code, variable b will be of type dace.int always, even if
`a[0] == np.float32(np.pi)`, unless it is explicitly declared as such:
```python
@dace.program
def single_target(a: dace.float32[1]):
    if (a[0] < 0):
        b = 0
    elif (a[0] < 1):
        b = 1
    else:
        b = a
    return b
```

### 8.2 The while statement
Supported

### 8.3 The for statement
Supported, but only with `range`, `parrange`, and `dace.map`.

### 8.4 The try statement
Unsupported

### 8.5 The with statement
Only supported `with dace.tasklet`

### 8.6 Function definitions
Supported only with the `dace.program` decorator. Function arguments must be
type-annotated. Nested `dace.program` definitions are not supported.

### 8.7 Class definitions
Unsupported

### 8.8 Coroutines
Unsupported

class InferGPUGridAndBlockSize(ppl.Pass):
    """
    Infers the 3D CUDA launch configuration (grid and block sizes) for all GPU_Device map entries in the SDFG.

    This pass assumes the `AddThreadBlockMap` transformation has already been applied, ensuring that each kernel
    either has an explicit thread block map. However it is applicable as long as each GPU_Device scheduled map
    has an inner explicit GPU_ThreadBlock scheduled map.

    Block sizes are determined based on:
    - Whether an explicit GPU_ThreadBlock map was inserted by `AddThreadBlockMap`. In this case,
      the `gpu_block_size` attribute holds this information.
    - Existing nested thread block maps and also the `gpu_block_size`, if present.

    Grid sizes are computed from the kernel map's range, normalized to a 3D shape.

    NOTE:
        This pass does not handle dynamic parallelism (i.e., nested GPU_Device maps),
        nor does it support GPU_ThreadBlock_Dynamic maps inside kernels. Behavior is unclear in
        such cases.

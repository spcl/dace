    """
    Analyze a control flow region to determine the number of times each block inside of it is executed in the form of a
    symbolic expression, or a concrete number where possible.
    Each control flow block is marked with a symbolic expression for the number of executions, and a boolean flag to
    indicate whether the number of executions is dynamic or not. A combination of dynamic being set to true and the
    number of executions being 0 indicates that the number of executions is dynamically unbounded.
    Additionally, the pass annotates each block with a `ranges` property, which indicates for loop variables defined
    at that block what range of values the variable may take on.
    Note: This path directly annotates the graph.
    This pass supersedes ``dace.sdfg.propagation.propagate_states`` and is based on its algorithm, with significant
    simplifications thanks to the use of control flow regions.

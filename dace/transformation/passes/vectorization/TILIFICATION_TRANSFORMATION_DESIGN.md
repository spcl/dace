# Tilification Transformation — Design Specification

**Status**: Draft for Tuesday freeze.
**Scope**: Lower a K-dim register tile (K ∈ {1, 2, 3}) onto AVX-512 / NEON /
SVE / scalar / cuTile back ends.
**Layout**: §§ 2-10 are the contract; §11 audits the current codebase
against it; §12 lists the gaps and the migration order; §13 holds the
schedule.

---

## 1. Goals

1. **One canonical body shape**: the tiled loop body is a NestedSDFG with
   full-array subsets on every connector. No pointer offsetting at the
   call site.
2. **One operand contract per lib node**: each library-node input is either
   a *full tile* (shape `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})`) or a *scalar* (length-1 / true
   `Scalar`). Nothing in between.
3. **One classification surface**: a per-dimension access lattice
   (§4) plus a single composition rule (§5). All higher-level emission
   decisions read from the lattice; the lattice falls back to GATHER when
   it cannot decide (§4.2).
4. **One mask shape**: every lib node accepts an optional `(K_0, …,
   K_{K-1})` mask; per-dim masking is uniformly expressed by broadcasting
   into the K-dim mask (§7).
5. **One remainder rule**: K boundary regions (not 2^K - 1), produced by
   the corner-absorbing peel (§8).
6. **Three gather forms** (full / per-dim / partial) on the same node,
   with affine fallback on omitted dims (§9).

---

## 2. Tiled Body — NestedSDFG With Full-Array Subsets

The outer Map iterates per-tile in each tiled dim (step `W_d` per dim).
Its body is a single `NestedSDFG` invocation per iteration. Contract:

| Connector kind | Subset                     | Inner reference                   |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Input          | full array `A[0:N_0, …]`   | `A_sub[i_0:i_0+W_0, …]`           |
| Output         | full array `A[0:N_0, …]`   | `A_sub[i_0:i_0+W_0, …]`           |
| Symbol         | passed via `symbol_mapping`| `i_d`, `j_d`, …                   |

**Invariants**:

- The call-site memlet is `A[0:N_0, …]` — the full extent on every dim.
- Per-tile addressing happens *inside* the body via `symbol_mapping`
  (the outer iter-vars enter as inner symbols).
- The body is responsible for staging its own reads/writes through
  transients (§3); the call convention itself never offsets.

**Rationale**: full-array subsets remove the only source of subset
confusion the descent and the inlined-outer-state port both fought (the
"connector array shape mismatch" family). A dedicated cleanup pass (G1
in §12) guarantees the convention is dataflow-safe.

---

## 3. Inside The Body — Tile Transients And The Scalar Exception

### 3.1 Staging rule

> Every non-transient read and write inside the tiled body is staged
> through a transient `Array(shape=widths, dtype=elem_dtype,
> storage=Register, transient=True)`.

The single exception: a **loop-invariant scalar broadcast** sourced
*before* the lane loop may stay at length 1 / `Scalar` shape. The lib
node that consumes it sees a `Scalar` operand (§6.2). The broadcast is a
column splat, a kernel argument, or any value that is the same across
every lane of every dim.

### 3.2 Why staging is load-bearing

Each lib node then sees either a full tile or a scalar — never a
partial-tile or strided-into-tile shape. All the "partial subset" /
"strided lane" complexity moves *out* of the lib nodes and *into* the
staging passes that produce the operand. That separation is what makes
the per-dim lattice (§4) implementable as a closed surface.

---

## 4. Per-Dimension Access Lattice

### 4.1 Kinds

Each tile dimension's access is classified as one of:

| Kind         | Definition                                                                  | Example                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **CONSTANT** | dim's index is loop-invariant (no tile iter-var anywhere in the expression) | `a[0]`, `a[N+1]`                         |
| **LINEAR**   | dim's index is exactly `iter_var + c` (stride 1, constant offset)           | `a[i]`, `a[i + 3]`                       |
| **AFFINE**   | dim's index is `s · iter_var + c` with `s`, `c` outer-scope constants       | `a[2*i + 1]`                             |
| **REPLICATE**| dim's index is `floor(c · iter_var + c0, k)` or `ceil(…)` (1 < k < W)       | `a[i//2]`, `a[i//4 + 7]`                 |
| **MODULAR**  | dim's index is `(c · iter_var + c0) % N` with `N` an outer-scope constant   | `a[i % N]`, `a[(2*i + 1) % N]`           |
| **GATHER**   | none of the above                                                           | `a[idx[i]]`, `a[i*j]`, `a[2*sym + 1]` (sym loop-variant) |

### 4.2 Lattice order and join rule

```
CONSTANT  ⊑  LINEAR  ⊑  AFFINE  ⊑  GATHER
                     ⊓        ⊓
                REPLICATE   MODULAR
```

- `CONSTANT ⊑ LINEAR ⊑ AFFINE ⊑ GATHER` is a strict chain.
- `REPLICATE` is **incomparable** with LINEAR / AFFINE — it is a separate
  axis (group broadcast inside the dim with factor `k`). The join of
  REPLICATE with anything outside `{CONSTANT, REPLICATE}` is GATHER.
- `MODULAR` is **incomparable** with LINEAR / AFFINE — it is a separate
  axis (cyclic wrap with period `N`). The join of MODULAR with anything
  outside `{CONSTANT, MODULAR}` is GATHER.

**Tile-aligned MODULAR → LINEAR reduction**:

For `a[(c · i_d + c_0) % N]`, if the classifier can prove `N` divides
`c · W_d` (the per-tile stride covers an integer number of wrap
periods), the access reduces to **LINEAR with a per-tile constant
offset**: every tile starts at `(c · i_d + c_0) mod N` (loop-invariant
within the tile) and lane `l_d` reads element `base + l_d`. The
classifier should emit LINEAR in this case; only the generic MODULAR
falls back to GATHER.

The common K=2 instance that triggers this reduction: `a[i % W_d]`
where the outer Map step is `W_d` ⇒ tile start ≡ 0 (mod `W_d`) ⇒
LINEAR with offset 0.

**Join rule (loop-variant coefficient → GATHER)**:

> When the classifier cannot prove a coefficient or offset is loop-
> invariant, the dim's kind is **GATHER**.

Examples:
- `a[2*sym + 1]` where `sym` is a tile iter-var or transitively depends
  on one (interstate-edge assignments inside the body) → **GATHER**.
- `a[2*sym + 1]` where `sym` is an outer-scope constant symbol →
  **AFFINE** with stride 2.
- `a[i*j]` (two tile iter-vars multiplied) → **GATHER** (the lattice
  rejects expressions with more than one tile iter-var contributing to
  a single dim).

This mirrors the FP-precision-type fallback: when in doubt, join up to
the strictest classification (GATHER) so correctness is preserved at
the cost of a slower path.

---

## 5. Cross-Dimension Composition

A tile access is a tuple `(d_0, …, d_{K-1})` of per-dim kinds. The
composition decides which lib node lowers the access and how its
properties are populated.

### 5.1 No-GATHER case — structured box

If `GATHER ∉ {d_0, …, d_{K-1}}` the access lowers to a single
`TileLoad` / `TileStore` parameterised by:

- `dim_strides[d]`: per-dim stride coefficient.
  - `0` for CONSTANT,
  - `1` for LINEAR,
  - `c` for AFFINE,
  - `1` for REPLICATE (the replicate factor lives in its own property).
- `replicate_factor_per_dim[d]`: per-dim group-broadcast factor.
  - `k` for REPLICATE dims,
  - `1` otherwise.
- `src_dims[d]` / `dst_dims[d]`: which source-array dim each tile dim
  binds to (handles Fortran / transposed inputs).

The lowered tile always has shape `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})`. Per-dim
replication / splatting happens *inside* the lib node's expansion, not
as a pre-pass.

### 5.2 Cross-dim broadcast resolution (sub-box → full tile)

When some dims are narrower than "one element per lane" (CONSTANT,
REPLICATE, or AFFINE-without-iter-var), the lib node replicates them to
fill the tile:

| Per-dim kind | Per-dim source range | Per-dim lane-to-source map           |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| CONSTANT     | 1 element            | every lane reads the same element    |
| LINEAR       | K_d elements         | lane `l` reads element `l`           |
| AFFINE       | K_d · s elements     | lane `l` reads element `l·s`         |
| REPLICATE    | K_d / k elements     | lane `l` reads element `floor(l/k)`  |

The Cartesian product of these per-dim maps gives the K-dim load pattern
that the expansion emits. **No mid-pipeline reshape pass is needed**;
the lib node's expansion does the broadcast at codegen time.

### 5.3 GATHER case

If any dim is GATHER, the entire access lowers to `TileGather` /
`TileScatter` (§9). Per-dim semantics survive: non-GATHER dims may still
be CONSTANT / LINEAR / AFFINE / REPLICATE and the gather node honours
their `dim_strides` / `replicate_factor` (i.e. those dims are addressed
affinely without a `_idx_<d>` connector).

### 5.4 Diagonal and transpose — fall back to GATHER

- **Diagonal** (`a[i, i]` where `(i, j)` are the K=2 tile vars): two
  LINEAR dims with the *same* iter-var. **Lowers as GATHER**, per-dim
  form (§9.2), with a 1-D `TileIota` index tile per dim.
- **Transpose** (`a[j, i]` where canonical lane order is `(i, j)`): K
  LINEAR dims in non-canonical permutation. **Lowers as GATHER**,
  per-dim form with permuted `TileIota` index tiles.

Both shapes are recognisable structurally but the design explicitly
falls back to GATHER for them — the per-dim gather form (§9.2) with
1-D index tiles is cheap enough that a dedicated structured load /
store path is not justified for the kernel corpus this pass targets.
A future dedicated path can land later behind the same lib-node
surface without breaking the operand contract.

## 6. Library Nodes

### 6.1 Node set (frozen for Tuesday)

| Node           | Purpose                                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `TileLoad`     | Structured tile load (§5.1)                        |
| `TileStore`    | Structured tile store                              |
| `TileGather`   | Indirect / mixed tile load (§9)                    |
| `TileScatter`  | Indirect / mixed tile store                        |
| `TileBinop`    | Elementwise binary op                              |
| `TileUnop`     | Elementwise unary op                               |
| `TileMerge`    | `where(mask, t, e)`                                |
| `TileReduce`   | Cross-lane reduction (tile → scalar only; §10.3)   |
| `TileMaskGen`  | ANY-dim-OOB conjunction → bool tile (§7.4)         |
| `TileIota`     | `arange`-style index seed for gather/scatter       |

### 6.2 Uniform operand contract

Every elementwise node (`TileBinop`, `TileUnop`, `TileMerge`) and
every store-style node accepts each operand as one of:

| Kind       | Connector         | Source                                                 | Lowering                                       |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Tile**   | `_a` / `_b` …     | tile-shaped `Array` `AccessNode`                       | per-lane register read                         |
| **Scalar** | `_a` / `_b` …     | length-1 / `dace.data.Scalar` `AccessNode`             | hardware splat (`_mm512_set1_pd`, `svdup_f64`) |
| **Symbol** | *no connector*    | symbolic expression in `expr_a` / `expr_b` property    | inline literal embedded in the per-lane body   |

**Hardware rationale for Scalar as a first-class kind**: AVX-512, NEON
and SVE all provide single-cycle broadcast intrinsics from a scalar
register; cuTile auto-broadcasts in its DSL. Routing a length-1 read
through a per-lane Tile would waste both a register and an extra load.

### 6.3 Symbolic broadcast

`Symbol` is not a degenerate `Scalar`. It is a *compile-time* constant
or symbolic expression embedded directly in the per-lane code string,
not materialised in any register. Use it for numeric literals
(`_out = _a + 1.0`) and outer-scope symbol broadcasts where no read
edge is needed.

---

## 7. Masking

### 7.1 Mask shape lock — full-tile boolean Array

The mask is **only ever a full-tile boolean Array**. Specifically:

- shape exactly `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})` — same shape as the lib node's tile
  operands;
- dtype `dace.bool_`;
- storage `Register`, `transient=True`.

No other mask form is accepted. Per-dim masks, scalar masks, or
non-bool predicates are all rejected at constructor / validate time
(§10). When only a single dim needs predication, the mask is still
generated at full `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})` shape — the unused dims contribute
the constant `true` to the conjunction and fold away at expansion
(§7.4).

**Rationale**: a uniform shape is the only contract that makes the
lib-node surface closed. Hardware mask registers (AVX-512 `__mmask8`,
SVE predicate registers, NEON synthesised) are flat under the hood;
the K-dim layering is purely a software notion, and the codegen
collapses it to a single predicate at use.

### 7.2 `has_mask` toggle

Each node has a `has_mask: bool` constructor knob. When `False` the
`_mask` connector is omitted entirely (no spurious wiring, no
per-iteration mask load). When `True` every load / store / op inside
the expansion threads the predicate.

### 7.3 No-mask short-circuit

The interior region of a `masked_tail` split has `has_mask=False` on
every node — the provably-divisible interior is the performance fast
path. Only the boundary regions carry masks.

### 7.4 `TileMaskGen` contract

For tile vars `(i_0, …, i_{K-1})` with widths `(W_0, …, W_{K-1})` and
global upper bounds `(N_0, …, N_{K-1})`, `TileMaskGen` emits the
ANY-dim-OOB conjunction:

```
mask[l_0, …, l_{K-1}] = (i_0 + l_0 < N_0) ∧ … ∧ (i_{K-1} + l_{K-1} < N_{K-1})
```

When a particular dim doesn't need masking (the corner-absorbing peel
of §8 covers it at full extent), its conjunct is the constant `true`
and folds away at expansion. The same lib node is used regardless of
which dim is being predicated.

### 7.5 Intra-tile (branch) masks

Branch normalisation produces `TileMerge` with an explicit condition
tile. The iteration mask (`_iter_mask`) and the condition mask combine
inside the expansion to a single effective mask. No separate
`TileMaskAnd` / `Or` / `Not` lib nodes are needed for the common case;
they remain out of scope until a kernel demands them (§10.5).

---

## 8. Remainder Loops

### 8.1 One remainder map per tiled dim

For K tiled dims the pipeline emits exactly **K + 1 regions**:

- 1 interior region (all tiled dims at main range, `has_mask=False`),
- K boundary regions (one per tiled dim, `has_mask=True`).

Untiled dims pass through at their full extent in every region.

### 8.2 Corner-absorbing peel (avoids 2^K - 1 corners)

For K=2 with tiled dims `(i, j)` and global bounds `(N_0, N_1)`,
widths `(W_0, W_1)`:

```
region 0 (interior):    i ∈ [0, ⌊N_0/W_0⌋·W_0),  j ∈ [0, ⌊N_1/W_1⌋·W_1)
region 1 (j boundary):  i ∈ [0, N_0),            j ∈ [⌊N_1/W_1⌋·W_1, N_1)
region 2 (i boundary):  i ∈ [⌊N_0/W_0⌋·W_0, N_0),j ∈ [0, ⌊N_1/W_1⌋·W_1)
```

The `(tail_i, tail_j)` corner is absorbed by region 1 (which iterates
the *full* i extent over j's tail). Region 2 only covers `(tail_i,
main_j)` so it doesn't overlap.

Generalises to K=3:

- 1 interior,
- 3 boundary regions (one per tiled dim),
- each boundary region's untiled dims (relative to it) are at full
  extent so all corners are absorbed.

### 8.3 Mask threading

Each boundary region runs `TileMaskGen` over the conjunction of its
tiled dim's `(i_d + l_d < N_d)` predicate. Absorbed-full dims
contribute `true` and fold away (§7.4). This way the lib-node
*interface* is uniform — `has_mask=True` everywhere a region needs
predication — even though the actual mask shape per region collapses
to a single non-trivial dim.

### 8.4 Strategies (existing knob)

The orchestrator's `remainder_strategy` selects:

- `masked_tail` (default for AVX-512 CPU): §8.1 + §8.2.
- `scalar_postamble`: boundary regions left as `Sequential` scalar
  loops, no masks. Used when the masked path measures slower than the
  scalar fallback.
- `full_mask`: single map, no split, `has_mask=True` everywhere
  (SVE default; runtime VL via `svwhilelt`).

---

## 9. Gather / Scatter Index Encoding

`TileGather` and `TileScatter` accept indices in three forms. Both the
full-tile form and the per-dim form are **first-class** — neither is
preferred over the other; the classifier picks whichever matches the
source pattern (separable → per-dim; cross-dim dependent → full). All
three forms share the same lib node; the form is identified
unambiguously by the **connector names**, which are unique and
non-overlapping:

| Form              | Connector(s)                              | Tile shape per connector  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Full N-D**      | `_idx_full`                               | `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})`       |
| **Per-dim**       | `_idx_0`, `_idx_1`, …, `_idx_{K-1}`       | `(K_d,)` each             |
| **Partial**       | a *subset* of `_idx_0`, …, `_idx_{K-1}`   | `(K_d,)` each             |

`_idx_full` and `_idx_<d>` never co-occur; their names are disjoint so
the expansion identifies the form by inspecting which connectors are
wired (no additional discriminator needed).

### 9.1 Full N-D index tile (`_idx_full`)

One `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})` integer tile. Per-lane:
`src[idx_full[l_0, …, l_{K-1}]]` decoded against the source array's
flat-index layout. The classifier emits this form when the gather
indices are **not separable** across tile dims — i.e. the index for
one dim depends on the lane in another dim (e.g. `src[idx[i, j]]`).

### 9.2 Per-dim index tiles (`_idx_0`, `_idx_1`, …)

K integer tiles, each of shape `(K_d,)`. Per-lane:
`src[idx_0[l_0], idx_1[l_1], …, idx_{K-1}[l_{K-1}]]`. The classifier
emits this form for **separable** patterns where each dim's index
depends only on that dim's lane index (diagonal, transpose, per-row
permutation, `src[idx0[i], idx1[j]]`). The 1-D per-dim tiles are much
cheaper to materialise than a full K-D index tile.

### 9.3 Partial index tiles

A *subset* of dims has a `_idx_<d>` connector wired; the rest fall
back to the affine default driven by `dim_strides[d]` /
`replicate_factor_per_dim[d]`. The classifier emits this form when a
multi-dim access has GATHER on a *subset* of dims; the non-GATHER dims
keep their per-dim kind and the GATHER dims get explicit indices. This
is structurally a special case of §9.2 (per-dim with some indices
omitted), but the validation rule is looser: missing indices are
permitted iff the corresponding dim's per-dim kind is non-GATHER.

### 9.4 Wire-level rule

A `TileGather` constructor takes:

```python
TileGather(name, widths, src_ndim,
           gather_dims: Tuple[int, ...],  # dims that carry an index (subset of [0..K))
           dim_strides, replicate_factor_per_dim, src_dims,
           index_form: Literal["full", "per_dim", "partial"],
           has_mask=False, pad_value=0)
```

- `index_form="full"`: connector `_idx_full` (shape
  `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})`). `gather_dims == tuple(range(K))`. The connector
  name `_idx_full` is unique and does NOT clash with `_idx_<d>`, so the
  expansion identifies the form by name lookup.
- `index_form="per_dim"`: connectors `_idx_0, …, _idx_{K-1}`,
  shape `(K_d,)` each. `gather_dims == tuple(range(K))`.
- `index_form="partial"`: connectors `_idx_<d>` only for `d ∈
  gather_dims`. Other dims use `dim_strides` / `replicate_factor`.

**Identifiability invariant**: `_idx_full` and `_idx_<d>` are
**mutually exclusive** — a `TileGather` with both wired is malformed
and rejected at `validate()`. The connector names are the source of
truth for the encoding form; `index_form` is a constructor-time
sanity flag and a downstream-pass hint.

The expansion handles all three with one switch on `index_form` at the
top of the codegen body; no separate node types.

---

## 10. Validation Rules

| Where        | Checks                                                                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constructor  | `widths` length in `{1, 2, 3}`; operand kinds in `{Tile, Scalar, Symbol}`; `index_form` / `gather_dims` consistency; replicate factors divide widths. |
| `validate()` | All declared connectors are wired; tile-operand dtypes match the output dtype (uniform-dtype lock); mask present iff `has_mask`; **mask descriptor is `Array(shape=widths, dtype=bool_, storage=Register, transient=True)`** (§7.1); `_idx_full` and `_idx_<d>` not both wired on the same node (§9.4). |
| Expansion    | Source array rank ≥ K; `src_dims` permutation valid; index tile shapes match `widths` (full / per-dim form); padding mode allowed. |

Loud failure at every layer. No silent fallbacks.

### 10.1 Operand-dtype uniformity (locked)

Tile operands across a single op share a dtype. Cross-dtype operations
(`f32 + f64`) raise `NotImplementedError` at `validate()` time. A mixed-
dtype kernel must materialise the cast through a `TileUnop` of kind
`cast_to_<dtype>` first. Rationale: AVX-512 / SVE lane widths differ per
dtype; supporting cross-dtype binops requires per-arch dispatch we'd
rather defer.

### 10.2 Mask descriptor lock

The `_mask` operand, when wired, is a `dace.data.Array` with shape
exactly `widths`, dtype `dace.bool_`, storage `Register`,
`transient=True`. Scalar masks, per-dim masks, non-bool predicates, or
non-Register storage are rejected at `validate()` time. The constructor
also rejects any `has_mask=True` request when the lib node's tile shape
is not declarable (e.g. an inconsistent operand width).

### 10.3 TileReduce shape lock (current slice)

`TileReduce` is locked to **full-tile → scalar** for the current slice:
a `(K_0, …, K_{K-1})` tile input reduces to a single value
(`dace.data.Scalar`). Axis-keep / per-row reductions
(e.g. tile → `(K_0,)` row) are recognised as future work but
**deliberately unimplemented**; the constructor refuses any `axis` /
`keepdims` argument. The classifier must not emit a partial-axis
reduction; if a kernel needs one it falls back to scalar code (the
remainder map's scalar postamble).

Rationale: keeping reductions tile→scalar avoids the per-arch
horizontal-shuffle plumbing that axis-keep would require (SVE
`svaddv` is global; AVX-512 needs a hand-rolled `_mm512_reduce_*`
plus per-row materialisation). Lift when a kernel demands it.

## 11. Implementation Audit

### 11.1 What the codebase already provides

|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| §4 Lattice   | [utils/tile_access.py:85](utils/tile_access.py): `PerDimKind` with `BROADCAST` / `STRUCTURED_1` / `REPLICATE` / `AFFINE` / `GATHER`. |
| §4.2 Join    | [utils/tile_access.py](utils/tile_access.py): partial — REPLICATE-detection via `int_floor`/`int_ceil`/`__int_floor`/`__int_ceil` ([line 340](utils/tile_access.py#L340)). **Missing**: explicit loop-variant-coefficient → GATHER. |
| §3 Staging   | [promote_inlined_map_to_tiles.py](promote_inlined_map_to_tiles.py): slice 1 widens body scalars; slice 2 rewrites binop/unop tasklets to lib nodes. |
| §3 Array↔scalar copies | [rewrite_array_scalar_to_tile_op.py](rewrite_array_scalar_to_tile_op.py): direct `AN(Array) ↔ AN(tile-transient)` edges → `TileLoad` / `TileStore`. |
| §6.1 Lib nodes | [libraries/tileops/nodes/](../../../libraries/tileops/nodes/): 10 lib nodes implemented (3,278 LoC).                |
| §6.2 Operand kinds | [tile_binop.py:62-65](../../../libraries/tileops/nodes/tile_binop.py#L62): `_TILE` / `_SCALAR` / `_SYMBOL`. `TileUnop` ditto. |
| §7.1 Mask shape | [tile_mask_gen.py](../../../libraries/tileops/nodes/tile_mask_gen.py): emits ANY-OOB conjunction at tile shape. |
| §7.2 `has_mask` | every lib node has the constructor knob.                                                       |
| §8.2 Corner-absorbing peel | [split_map_for_tile_remainder.py](split_map_for_tile_remainder.py): comments at lines 7-34 describe the K boundary peel; impl appears to match. **Audit pending** (G5). |
| §8.4 Strategies | [vectorize_cpu_multi_dim.py:133-228](vectorize_cpu_multi_dim.py#L133): `full_mask` / `masked_tail` / `scalar_postamble` knob. |
| §5.1 `replicate_factor_per_dim` | [tile_load.py:310](../../../libraries/tileops/nodes/tile_load.py#L310). Wired through pure expansion. |
| §9.1 Single index tile | [tile_gather.py](../../../libraries/tileops/nodes/tile_gather.py): per-dim `_idx_<k>` connectors already exist for the K=2 / K=3 case (one connector per source-array dim). |

### 11.2 Vocabulary gap (cosmetic, mechanical commit)

The spec uses **CONSTANT / LINEAR / AFFINE / REPLICATE / MODULAR /
GATHER**. The codebase uses **BROADCAST / STRUCTURED_1 / REPLICATE /
AFFINE / GATHER** (no MODULAR yet). Rename + add MODULAR in
[utils/tile_access.py](utils/tile_access.py):

| Spec       | Code today      | Action                                |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| CONSTANT   | `BROADCAST`     | rename enum member                    |
| LINEAR     | `STRUCTURED_1`  | rename enum member                    |
| AFFINE     | `AFFINE`        | keep                                  |
| REPLICATE  | `REPLICATE`     | keep                                  |
| MODULAR    | *(absent)*      | **add new enum member** + detector    |
| GATHER     | `GATHER`        | keep                                  |

`TileAccessKind.BROADCAST` / `.STRUCTURED` (the whole-subset kind) also
get the analogous rename. Single mechanical commit, no behaviour
change. Update the compat shim, descent, and outer-state pass call
sites in the same commit.

### 11.3 Six gaps — see §12

---

## 12. Gaps And Action Items

Each item is a single self-contained slice. Ordering reflects
dependencies; landing them in order keeps every commit green.

### G1 — NSDFG body call convention: full subsets, no offsetting

**Why**: Section 2 says "no pointer offsetting at the call site". The
descent's existing wider machinery
([expand_nested_sdfg_inputs.py](expand_nested_sdfg_inputs.py),
[insert_body_nsdfg_copies.py](insert_body_nsdfg_copies.py)) already
covers part of this, but the *convention* — full-array memlets on every
connector — is not yet enforced as an invariant.

**What lands**: a single pass `EnforceFullSubsetNSDFGBody` that, for each
tile-tagged Map whose body is a NestedSDFG:

1. Widens every connector memlet on the outer NSDFG node to
   `array[0:N_0, …, 0:N_{D-1}]`.
2. Asserts the inner body still references the correct per-tile region
   via `symbol_mapping`.
3. Refuses (NotImplementedError) when the outer subset cannot be widened
   safely (e.g. the connector has aliased non-disjoint writes upstream).

Unit tests on hand-built K=1 and K=2 fixtures.

**Owner**: standalone pass; lives next to
[promote_nsdfg_body_to_tiles.py](promote_nsdfg_body_to_tiles.py).

### G2 — Vocabulary rename (mechanical)

See §11.2. Single commit. Update both
[utils/tile_access.py](utils/tile_access.py) and
[utils/tile_access_compat.py](utils/tile_access_compat.py).
Bonus: drop the now-redundant `TileAccessKind` enum and use
`PerDimKind` everywhere with a top-level "whole-subset kind = max of
per-dim kinds" helper.

### G3 — Per-dim partial gather indices (`_idx_<d>` semantics)

**Why**: §9.3. The classifier needs to be able to emit a `TileGather`
that takes indices for only the GATHER dims and leaves the others on
the affine path.

**What lands**:

1. Extend `TileGather` constructor with `gather_dims: Tuple[int, ...]`
   and `index_form: Literal["full", "per_dim", "partial"]` (§9.4).
2. Make the expansion read `index_form` at the top and switch.
3. Update the classifier to emit the right form: when a subset has
   mixed kinds with some GATHER, prefer `index_form="partial"` and
   set `gather_dims` to the GATHER-dim indices.
4. Mirror the same surface on `TileScatter`.

Unit tests on three fixtures: full, per-dim, partial.

### G4 — Lattice join in the classifier

**Why**: §4.2 says loop-variant coefficient → GATHER. The current
classifier ([utils/tile_access.py:316](utils/tile_access.py#L316))
detects REPLICATE but doesn't have the explicit "if any symbol in the
expression transitively depends on a tile iter-var → GATHER" check.

**What lands**: a helper `_is_loop_invariant(expr, iter_vars,
inner_sdfg) -> bool` that walks the free symbols and the body's
interstate-edge assignments transitively. The classifier uses it to
decide AFFINE vs GATHER for ambiguous coefficients.

### G5 — Audit `SplitMapForTileRemainder` for §8.2

**Why**: the docstring at
[split_map_for_tile_remainder.py:7-34](split_map_for_tile_remainder.py#L7)
describes the K-boundary peel, but the spec requires it as a
*correctness* invariant. Need a unit test (or several) that constructs
a K=2 map with N_0 % W_0 ≠ 0 ∧ N_1 % W_1 ≠ 0 and asserts the produced
SDFG has **exactly 3 regions** (interior + 2 boundary), not 4
(2^K - 1 = 3 boundary + interior is fine; 2^K = 4 with separate
corner is the failure mode to catch).

### G6 — Symbol-coefficient distinction

**Why**: §4.2 split: `a[N*i]` where `N` is an outer constant → AFFINE;
where `N` depends on `i` → GATHER. This is the velocity-tendencies
trigger pattern. The classifier currently treats `N*i` as AFFINE with
symbolic stride; need to gate that on `N`'s loop-invariance (G4 covers
the helper; G6 wires it into the AFFINE path).

### G2-also — drop `_operand_kind` partial in slice 2

The slice-2 outer-state operand classifier
([promote_inlined_map_to_tiles.py](promote_inlined_map_to_tiles.py)
`_operand_kind`) currently handles Tile + Symbol only. Once G3 +
G4 land, extend it to:

- broadcast Scalar (length-1 source in scope),
- gather index (NDTile walk-back: a transient hides an N-D source
  per-lane read behind a length-1 operand).

This is the slice-2 deliverable's GATHER extension.

## 14. Out Of Scope (Explicit Non-Goals)

These are deliberately excluded from this design; revisit only when a
concrete kernel demands them:

- **Mask combinators as lib nodes** (`TileMaskAnd` / `Or` / `Not`).
  Branch normalisation produces `TileMerge` which is sufficient for
  the current kernel corpus.
- **Cross-tile (across-Map-invocations) reductions**. `TileReduce`
  reduces within one tile; across-tile is a separate concern handled
  by the WCR / reduce-scope machinery in the rest of DaCe.
- **GPU `TileScatter` with cross-block conflicts**. Single-thread-per-
  lane block layouts only; cross-block atomics deferred.
- **Mixed dtypes inside a single op** (§10.1). Materialise via an
  explicit cast `TileUnop` first.
- **K ≥ 4**. The constructors refuse `len(widths) > 3` at construction
  time. Lift only when a kernel justifies the register pressure.
- **Diagonal / transpose as dedicated structured patterns**. Both fold
  into GATHER for now (§5.4); a structured fast path can land later
  behind the same `TileGather` surface.
- **Auto-classify load node** (a single node that defers
  classification to its expansion). The pipeline-time classifier
  already covers it cleanly; adding an umbrella node would duplicate
  the lattice. Marked NOT pursued.

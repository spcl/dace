"""Inside-body staging pass (design section 3 + section 3.3).

For each tile-tagged Map's body NSDFG, walks every non-transient
AccessNode and stages each per-tile-subset access through a fresh
transient. The shape of the staged transient is picked from the per-
dim lattice (section 4):

* CONSTANT on every tile dim
    -> ``Scalar`` (or length-1 Array) transient. Direct AN -> AN scalar
       copy (no tasklet); the lib node downstream consumes it via the
       ``Scalar`` operand kind with hardware splat.

* At least one dim in {LINEAR, AFFINE, REPLICATE, MODULAR}
    -> ``(K_0, ..., K_{K-1})`` Array transient. AN -> TileLoad ->
       transient (read) / transient -> TileStore -> AN (write).

* Any dim is GATHER
    -> same tile-shape transient; the TileLoad / TileStore carries
       ``gather_dims=...`` + variable-shape ``_idx_<d>`` connectors
       fed by PreparePerLaneIndices.

This is the inside-body counterpart of the staging design
(STAGE_GLOBAL_THROUGH_SCALARS_SPEC.md): the outer global accesses now
flow through staged transients first, and the lib nodes are emitted at
the boundary inside the body. No non-transient AccessNode survives in
the middle of the body's dataflow.

Status (incremental landing):

* Step 1 (this commit): module-level helper :func:`stage_constant_access`
  that handles the CONSTANT-only case (direct AN -> AN scalar copy).
  Pass scaffold with a stub ``apply_pass`` that documents the contract.
  Unit tests for the helper.
* Step 2 (follow-up): :func:`stage_tile_access` for the
  LINEAR / AFFINE / REPLICATE / MODULAR case with TileLoad emission.
* Step 3 (follow-up): GATHER case + integration with
  :class:`PreparePerLaneIndices`.
* Step 4 (follow-up): Pass walker drives the helpers across every
  body NSDFG.

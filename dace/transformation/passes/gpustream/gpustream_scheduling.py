class NaiveGPUStreamScheduler(ppl.Pass):
    """
    Assigns GPU streams to nodes and stores the assignments in a dictionary.
    This can be useful for enabling asynchronous and parallel GPU computation using GPU streams.

    Strategy Overview:
    ------------------
    - GPU stream assignment is based on weakly connected components (WCCs) within each state.
    - Nodes in the same WCC are assigned to the same stream.
    - For top-level states (not within nested SDFGs), each new WCC starts on a new stream (starting from 0).
    - In nested SDFGs:
        * Stream assignment is inherited from the parent component,
        * All internal components share the parent's stream.
    - GPU stream IDs wrap around according to the `max_concurrent_streams` configuration.

    Example:
    --------
    A state with the following independent chains:
        K1 → K2
        K3 → K4 → K5
        K6

    would be scheduled as:
        K1, K2     → stream 0
        K3, K4, K5 → stream 1
        K6         → stream 2

    (assuming no limit on the number of concurrent streams)

    Note:
    -----
    These refer to **backend GPU streams** (e.g., CUDA or HIP), not DaCe symbolic streams.
